In this chapter, we are going to see how to enable authenticating end user with Istio.
At the time of writing this chapter, only the JWT mechanism is supported.

== Enabling User-End Authentication

Now it is time to enable end-user authentication.

The first thing you need to do is run `curl istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.$(minishift ip).nip.io` and validate that now it is still possible to communicate between all services without been authenticated.

[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.{appdomain}/{path}

customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'b4d67bcb7-7rp88': 4
----

Then run:

[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl create -f link:{github-repo}/{istiofiles-dir}/enduser-authentication-jwt.yml[istiofiles/enduser-authentication-jwt.yml]
----

Then let's run the curl again:

[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.{appdomain}/{path}

Origin authentication failed.%`
----

And now the communication is not possible because the user has not been identified (provides a valid JWT token).

To get a correct token, just run next `curl` request.

[source, bash]
----
token=$(curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lordofthejars/a02485d70c99eba70980e0a92b2c97ed/raw/f16b938464b01a2e721567217f672f11dc4ef565/token.simple.jwt -s)

echo $token
----

Then let's repeat the request but passing the token stored in `token` variable.

[source, bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.{appdomain}/{path}

customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'b4d67bcb7-7rp88': 4
----

Now just change some part of the token and send the request again, you'll notice that request is refused.

====
In this chapter you've seen how to enable end-user authentication with JWT.

Obviously, you should also keep enabled mTLS to avoid any attacker could take the token.

Check xref:8mTLS.adoc[mTLS section] to learn more about mTLS and Istio.
